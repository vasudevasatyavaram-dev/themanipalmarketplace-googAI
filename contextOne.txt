**UI/UX Overhaul: Analytics & Best Practices**

**Overview:**
1.  **Analytics Lock Screen:** Improved the "locked" state of the Analytics section for new sellers. A larger, more prominent lock icon with the brand's accent color has been introduced to make the call-to-action clearer and more visually appealing.
2.  **Best Practices Redesign:** The "Best Practices" guide has been completely redesigned from a simple text article into a modern, engaging, card-based layout. Each best practice is now presented in its own card with a unique icon, title, and clear bullet points, making the information much easier to scan, digest, and remember. This visual overhaul breaks the monotony and significantly enhances the user experience.

**Feature: Link to Customer Storefront**

**Overview:**
To provide sellers with quick access to the customer-facing marketplace, a new icon has been added to the header. This allows sellers to easily view the live website where their products are displayed.

**Behavior & Visual Changes:**
1.  **New Storefront Icon:** A new icon, representing a storefront, is now positioned to the left of the main menu button in the header.
2.  **External Link:** Clicking this icon opens the customer marketplace website (`https://themanipalmarketplace-seller.vercel.app/`) in a new browser tab. This prevents sellers from losing their place in the dashboard.
3.  **Consistent Styling:** The button is styled identically to the main menu button, ensuring a clean and consistent UI.
4.  **Mobile-Friendly:** The icon is compact and does not add clutter to the mobile header, maintaining the application's mobile-first design.

**Refactor: Isolate Login Page Component**

**Overview:**
To improve project structure and make the login component more independent, the login page logic has been moved from `components/auth/Login.tsx` into a new, dedicated file at the project root: `LoginPage.tsx`. The main `App.tsx` has been updated to use this new component. This is a structural refactor with no changes to the login page's functionality or appearance.

**Audit: Final Code Quality & Consistency Check**

**Overview:**
A final audit was performed to ensure the highest code quality. This involved identifying and eliminating code duplication, cleaning up obsolete files, and fixing minor inconsistencies.

**Implementation Details:**
1.  **Deduplication:**
    *   **Image Utility:** The `getCroppedFile` helper function, which was present in both the Add and Edit modals, has been extracted into a single, reusable function in `services/imageUtils.ts`.
    *   **Shared Icons:** The `GoogleIcon` (used in Login and Profile) and `CropIcon` (used in product forms) were duplicated. They have been moved into their own shared component files in `components/ui/` to ensure consistency and maintainability.
2.  **File Cleanup:** The obsolete `components/auth/Login.tsx` file, a remnant of a previous refactor, has been deleted from the project to prevent confusion.
3.  **Type Safety:** A minor type inconsistency in the "Quantity" input field's state between the Add and Edit modals was identified and resolved, making the component's props and state management more robust.

**Refactor: Independent Authentication Module**

**Overview:**
To make the login experience completely self-contained and improve code organization, the entire authentication flow has been refactored into its own independent module. This isolates all auth-related UI and logic from the main application shell.

**Implementation Details:**
1.  **New `AuthPage.tsx`:** A new root component has been created to serve as the single entry point for the unauthenticated user experience.
2.  **New `AuthLayout.tsx`:** A reusable layout component was created to provide the consistent background and centering for the login page and initial loading screen.
3.  **New `BrandHeader.tsx`:** A shared component now renders the brand's logo and title. It includes a `loading` variant to ensure visual consistency between the login page and the app's initial loading state, eliminating duplicated code.
4.  **Refactored `LoginPage.tsx`:** The component has been streamlined to contain only the login/signup form card and its associated logic, making it a highly focused and reusable form component.
5.  **Simplified `App.tsx`:** The main app component is now cleaner. It decides whether to show the new `<AuthPage />` or the `<Dashboard />`, and it leverages the new shared components for its loading screen.

This refactoring fully encapsulates the "HTML and anything else linked to the login," as requested, resulting in a cleaner, more modular, and more maintainable codebase.

**Refactor: Independent Login HTML Entry Point**

**Overview:**
To make the authentication module truly independent and reusable across different applications (e.g., a seller dashboard and a customer website), a dedicated HTML entry point has been created. This ensures the login page has zero dependencies on the main application's JavaScript bundle or routing.

**Implementation Details:**
1.  **New `login.html`:** A new HTML file was created specifically for the login experience. It contains the exact same global styling, fonts, and Tailwind CSS configuration as the main application to ensure a visually identical look and feel, but it is a completely separate file.
2.  **New `login.tsx`:** A new TypeScript entry point was created for `login.html`. Its sole responsibility is to render the `<AuthPage />` component, which is the root of the self-contained authentication module.

This change completes the architectural separation of the login flow, making it a fully standalone module that can be easily deployed or reused elsewhere without modification.
